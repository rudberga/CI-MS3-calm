<p align="center"><strong>Milestone 3 project - Full Stack Web Developer course - Code Institute</strong></p>

This website is developed for users who wants to find artists who makes calm music. Maybe you need it for a rainy day, when you have to focus on studying or just to fall asleep in the evening. For any reason there is, this website will help the user to find new artists and contribute by adding their own. It is based on user contributions and you will be able to read others artist cards as well as add, delete and edit your own posts.

## UX

### User Stories

See below user stories:

> *- "As a user of the website, I expect to find a layout which is user friendly, so I easily can navigate throughout the website"*

> *- "As a user of the website, I expect to be able to register an account, so I can add, edit and delete my own artists"*

> *- "As a first time visitor of the website, I expect to be able to see artists without having to register, so I can get an idea of how the website works"*

> *- "As a user of the website, I expect to have all my own posts gathered on my profile page, so I easily can get an overview of my contributions"*

> *- "As a user of the website, I expect to be able to sign up for a newsletter, so I can get updates straigh to my inbox"*

> *- "As a user of the website, I expect to have easy access to social links, so I can check and possibly follow the social accounts"*

> *- "As a user of the website, I expect to get basic information and a link to the artist in the artist cards, so I can be informed before clicking the link"*

### Strategy

The main goal of this website is to create a sort of hub where users can come to find new artist they have not heard about, and also contribute with their own. The focus is on calm music so the users can trust that they will only get those recommendations. Users will be able to check artist without creating an account, however, in order to add their own artists they need to create an account.

Project goals: 

- Design a website which not only is user friendly and modern, but also brings a sense of calm by the design choices
- Present an inspiring page with artists cards where relevant info about the artist is included
- Present a smooth way for the user to add, edit and delete their contributions
- Give the user a simple way of registering, logging in and logging out

### Scope

The features of this website will let the users:

- Find artists through the artist page
- Search for artist in the search bar based on name, genre or nationality
- Register your own account so you can log in and contribute to the website
- Add artists for suggestion to other users, edit and delete them as well
- Include direct links to Spotify for easier navigation to listen to the artist

### Structure

The design and layout of this website will focus on the word 'calm'. Therefore picking up both the color theme and details such as rounded corners on all buttons, to remove elements that might pose as 'harsh'. The word 'calm' also made me focus on using modals to create a smoother experience for the user, not having to see a new rendered page for each button they press.

### Skeleton

[Wireframe](static/docs/ci-ms3-calm.pdf)

6 pages included in the wireframe which are:
- Landing Page
- Login Modal
- Register Modal
- Artist Page
- Add Artist Module
- Profile Page

### Surface

#### Main inspiration
 
I took my main inspiration from the world 'calm' and what I associate with it, also what I believe other people associate with it. What I came up with was to base the design out of the color blue and feeling of a forrest with a lake. The shade of blue comes together with a green tone to give the calming appearance of the website. Nothing screams out in terms of color or shape.

#### Fonts

For the fonts in this project I decided to play with the font weights of the font 'Barlow'. I think this font fits my website as it is not too aggressive in its approach and it looks modern.

#### Barlow weight 400

This is the font weight used for standard text such as inside the artist cards

![Barlow](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS3-calm/blob/master/static/img/barlow-400.png?raw=true "Barlow 400 weight")

#### Barlow weight 700

This is the font weight used for the bigger texts such as on the landing page
